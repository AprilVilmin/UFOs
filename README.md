# UFOs, JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap

## Overview of Project
McMinnville, OR is the home of multiple UFO sightings and is the hometown of Dana a data journalist who loves to write about them. Dana is writing an aritcle about UFO sightings and as a JavaScript File with this data on it. This file contains information on countries, states and cities. Dana plans to use the information from the Java Script file to create vizsualizations. Dana wants to publish her article and visualizations as a html page. Dana's inital html is working, but she wants to enhance it's functionality by adding filters for shape, city, state and country.

## Results

Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation.


## Summary 
One drawback I see on the design of the new website is that there is not a button to reset the filters on the screen without backing out your enter manually or refreshing the entire page when you want to change your filters. A future recommendation for this page would be to build off of this drawback by adding a filter refresh button to the screen. Another one of my recommendations would be to clean the data before loading it onto the wesbite. If you look at the 'Duration' column on the website you will see minutes displayed as 'min', 'mins','minutes', 'minuets', 'min.' and other formats. Please see screenshot below. This along with other time formats are displaying differently in this column. This is only a cosmetic issue as of now, but could become more of an issue if a filter was added on the 'Duration' column. Cleaning up of the data could also be done to capatialize the city, state and country columns and complete proper puncuation and sentence structure in the comments column. Another example of roomfor improvement could be grouping the the items not only by date order, but by date order then by country, state and city or something similar. In doing something like this you could easily see if a city had two or more UFO sightings on one day.
