# UFOs, JavaScript, HTML and Bootstrap

## Overview of Project
McMinnville, OR is the home of multiple UFO sightings and is the hometown of Dana a data journalist who loves to write about them. Dana is writing, an article, about UFO sightings and has a JavaScript File with this data on it. This file contains information on countries, states, and cities. Dana plans to use the information from the JavaScript file to create visualizations. Dana wants to publish her article and visualizations as a html page. Dana's initial html is working, but she wants to enhance its functionality by adding filters for shape, city, state, and country.

## Results
The website can be utilized to access a variety of information regarding UFO sightings: including when they happened, what city, state, and country they happened in, what the shape of the UFO was, the duration of the sighting and what comments, if any, are available per sighting. The website also provides a search feature where you can filter by date, city, state, country, or shape. You can also sort using any combination of these filters. Please see the screenshots below for additional details.

### Website (Unfiltered)

### Website Filtered by Date
There are five filters on the left side of the screen. You can filter by date by entering a date in the 'Enter Date' filter. In the example below the date of '1/8/2010' was entered. When filtered on this date only the sightings with the date of '1/8/2010' display.

### Website Filtered by Date and City
More than one filter may be applied at a time. In the example below, both the 'Enter Date' filter and the 'Enter a City' filter are utilized. The date of '1/8/2010' was entered, in the 'Enter Date' field in the above example and then the additional filter of 'boulder' was entered in the 'Enter a City' filter.

### Website Filtered by State
There are two ways two reset filters (return the website/data to its original state) so that you may set new filter(s). The first is to click the reset button at the top of the page and the second is to delete/back out the text entered in the filter fields and press the enter button. Once the website is returned to its original state, enter the new filter(s). To filter on the state, enter the state abbreviation (in lower case letters) in the 'Enter a State' filter and press the 'Enter' key. The below example is filter to California by using the abbreviation of 'ca'.

### Website Filtered by Date and Shape
In the example below, both the 'Enter Date' filter and the 'Enter a Shape' filter are utilized. The date of '1/8/2010' was entered in the 'Enter Date' field and then the additional filter of 'light' was entered in the 'Enter a Shape' filter. Prior to setting the filters in this example, the filter(s) were reset using one of the two ways outlined above.

## Summary 
One drawback I see on the design of the new website is that there is not a button to reset the filters on the screen without backing out the filter entry or refreshing the entire page when you want to change your filters. A future recommendation for this page would be to build from this drawback by adding a filter refresh button to the screen. Another one of my recommendations would be to clean the data before loading it onto the website. If you look at the 'Duration' column on the website you will see minutes displayed as 'min', 'mins', 'minutes', 'minuets', 'min.' and other formats. Please see screenshots of various minute layouts below. This along with other time formats are displaying differently in this column. This is only a cosmetic issue as of now but could become more of an issue if a filter were added on the 'Duration' column. While cleaning up the data one could also capitalize the city, state and country columns and complete proper punctuation and sentence structure in the comments column. Another example of room for improvement could be grouping the items not only by date order, but by date order then by country, state and city or something similar. In doing something like this you could easily see if a city had two or more UFO sightings on one day. The more familiar Dana becomes with her Dana the more opportunities for improvements she will find.
